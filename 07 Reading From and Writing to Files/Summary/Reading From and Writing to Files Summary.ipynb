    "\n",
    "There are a few different things you can do to read from the file once it's open. One of the most useful methods is ```readlines```. This returns a list, where each item is the content of a single line of the input file. In the example below, you can see that each line ends in a ```\\n```, representing a new line character. From here you can use string processing techniques (such as ```strip``` and ```split```) to process the data in the list. Remember, this data will all be read as strings, so you may need to convert it to another type before using it. There are elegant and creative ways to process data read from a file, feel free to combine different techniques, methods and functions."
