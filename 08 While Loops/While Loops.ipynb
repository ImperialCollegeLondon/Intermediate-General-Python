    "To create a while loop, we write the word ```while```, followed by an expression and a colon. The truthiness of this statement will be evaluated and the indented section of code which follows will be executed repeatedly while the statement is truthy. Then the truthiness of the expression will be evaluated again and, if truthy, the indented code will be evaluated again. If the expression is falsy, the execution of code will move to the first line after the indented section. This means, if the expression is falsy to start with, the indented code will never be executed.\n",

Essentially, an upper andd lower bound are selected. At one the function is positive, at the other, the function is negative. We select a point halfway between the lower and upper bounds. If the value at that midway point is positive, the bound for which the function value is positive is changed to the value of midway point. If the function is negative at the midway point, the bound for which the function value is negative is changed to the value of midway point. This process is repeated until the upper and lower bounds are close enough together than the midway point approximates the root.\n",

    "The code below is an example of this algorithm, implemented using a while loop to judge when the solution is sufficiently converged.
